Authorities determined a cause of death for actor Gene Hackman and his wife Betsy Arakawa, New Mexico chief medical examiner Heather Jarrell announced Friday.

“I'd like to begin by stating that it is unprecedented for the office of the medical investigator to make public statements about death investigations,” Jarrell said at a news conference. “However, the circumstances surrounding these two deaths require accurate dissemination of important information.”

On Feb. 27, the day after the 95-year-old actor and his 64-year-old wife were found dead, the office performed autopsies.

Hackman’s cause of death was determined to be hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. He was in an advanced state of Alzheimer’s disease, Jarrell said, explaining that he might have died without knowing about his wife’s condition. He did not show signs of dehydration.
